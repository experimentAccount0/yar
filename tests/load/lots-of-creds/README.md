When running load tests it's important to make sure the
[Key Store](../../yar/key_store)
contains enough credentials to make it representitive of a key
store which could be found in a real deploment. This directory
contains scripts that pre-generate large numbers of credentials
for use during a load test. For more details on these scripts
take a quick look at the commentary at the start of the scripts.
See [gen_basic_creds](gen_basic_creds)
and [create_big_key_stores](create_big_key_stores).
