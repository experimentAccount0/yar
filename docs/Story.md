### The Story
* a policy is a (written) statement of intent
* policies are implemented by procedures
* (application) controls ensure procedures are executed as per the policy
* authentication verifies identity
* an access control model describes the operations a principal can perform on an object
* it should be possible to explicitly grant and revoke access to an object in an access control model
* authorization updates an access control model
* access approval uses the access control model to determine if a principal is permitted to access an object
* accounting records all authentication, authorization and access activity
* accounting enables activities such as billing, trending analysis and capacity planning
