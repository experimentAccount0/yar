This directory contains scripts that pre-generate
large numbers of credentials which can be quickly loaded into a
[Key Store](../../../yar/key_store)
during load tests so the
[Key Store](../../../yar/key_store)'s
data shape is representitive of what could be found in a production deployment.

For more details on the scripts
take a look at the commentary at the start of:

* [gen_basic_creds](gen_basic_creds)
* [create_big_key_stores](create_big_key_stores)
