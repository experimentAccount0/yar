   MAC key identifier
         A string identifying the MAC key used to calculate the request
         MAC.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  The server
         typically assigns a specific scope and lifetime to each set of
         MAC credentials.  The identifier MAY denote a unique value used
         to retrieve the authorization information (e.g. from a
         database), or self-contain the authorization information in a
         verifiable manner (i.e. a string consisting of some data and a
         signature).
   MAC key
         A shared symmetric secret used as the MAC algorithm key.  The
         server MUST NOT issue the same MAC key and MAC key identifier
         combination.
   MAC algorithm
         A MAC algorithm used to calculate the request MAC.  Value MUST
         be one of "hmac-sha-1", "hmac-sha-256", or a registered
         extension algorithm name as described in Section 8.1.
         Algorithm names are case-sensitive.  If the MAC algorithm is
         not understood by the client, the client MUST NOT use the MAC
         credentials and continue as if no MAC credentials were issued.
   Issue time
         The time when the credentials were issued, used to calculate
         the credentials age when making requests.  If the MAC
         credentials were obtained via an HTTP response, the time of
         issue is the time the response was received by the client.

   The MAC key identifier, MAC key, MAC algorithm strings MUST NOT
   include characters other than:


     %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E
     ; Any printable ASCII character except for <"> and <\>
